Trenton Foster (T-ren)

Rap Album 1: Swagpocalypse
Song 1: Itanimulli
I'm spinning rhymes like a BeyBlade (),
My rhymes are so explosive, just like a grenade.
I'm sitting in this chair, making so much dough,

Shreking all these scrubs, because I'm running the show.

T-Ren booting up like dial up connection,

Not that far away from rap game perfection.

Shoutout to elementary schools all around the nation,

This song is coming at you like an education salvation.

I'm the MVP of the dream team, the supreme meme, and you know it's not what it seems,


because like a cat I'm the unseen deen of Lightning McQueen.

This line is the greatest verse you'll hear in the whole universe.

Swag. Ballin.But. seriously.this.verse.
