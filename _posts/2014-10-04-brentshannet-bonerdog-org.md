Message Body:  
Kyouko cocked a grin. “’Course not. You’re not that sort of girl.” She placed her mouth over one and swirled her tongue, watching the reaction on Mami’s face. She slowed her pace, and then sped up. The repetition made Mami try to pull away, but Kyouko wouldn’t let her. She pinned Mami’s arms to the bed. 

“K-Kyouko…” Mami shuddered. 

Instead of answering, Kyouko removed her mouth, blowing softly onto the exposed wet nipple. She was encouraged by the soft sounds Mami emitted and switched to the other breast. She couldn’t let just one have all the fun. 

Meanwhile, Mami was trying to maneuver her body so that she could regain the upper hand. She had no plans to lie back while Kyouko teased her so. Kyouko’s strength worked against her, even as she pushed against Kyouko’s hands. Kyouko had her waist pinned down, but she had failed to pay attention to her own position. She had not settled between Mami’s legs, but over one, which meant… 

“Gah, fuck!” Kyouko shouted as Mami’s knee slowly slid against the inside of her thighs. Her hands released their hold on Mami’s arms. 

Mami took advantage of the distraction and rose, flipping Kyouko onto her back. Now she was the one who pinned Kyouko, smiling softly. “I can play too,” she whispered. “If you struggle too much, I’ll use my ribbons to keep you still.” 

Conflicted emotions tormented Kyouko. She wanted to protest and struggle. She wanted to regain her position on top again. However, a part of her was eager to see what Mami would do. A small part of her even wanted to struggle, and force Mami to bind her arms and legs. She had no idea she even had such an opinion until this very moment. 

Kyouko felt the edge of her tank top slowly being pushed upward. As Mami removed the garment, she bent over, kissing a trail upon Kyouko’s skin. Kyouko arched her back as Mami pushed the shirt over her breasts. She had picked today of all days to not wear a bra beneath her shirt. She blushed, and realized how Mami had felt earlier. She raised her head as Mami slipped the shirt over, Kyouko’s arms falling back to her side. 

Mami never gave her the chance to cover herself up. She pressed herself against Kyouko, kissing her firmly. Kyouko tried to protest, but her words were silenced. Her hands rose, intending to push Mami away, but instead they wrapped around Mami’s waist and pulled her closer. Her fingers slipped between them and undid the button of Mami’s black slacks. She slid them, along with Mami’s panties, down over Mami’s hips. Mami assisted, kicking the slacks blindly off the bed. 

In return, Mami reached for the metal button on Kyouko’s shorts, deftly unclasping it and removing Kyouko’s shorts. However, she left Kyouko clad in her underwear. Kyouko, too busy kissing Mami, didn’t realize this until Mami slipped her hand between the two of them and ran her fingers over the fabric. Instantly, Kyouko closed her legs, trying to keep Mami from seeing how sensitive she was. Mami only laughed softly. “I will use those ribbons if I need to,” she reminded Kyouko, whispering into her ear. She smiled as she felt Kyouko slowly open her legs. 

Her fingers pressed lightly, moving back and forth. She watched Kyouko’s face, smiling as Kyouko struggled to keep from making noise. Her fingers moved forward and slipped inside the fabric. Kyouko’s eyes went wide. “M-Mami!” 

“Shhh…” Kyouko’s arousal encouraged Mami. She removed her fingers, and rid Kyouko of her last article of clothing. Mami lay against Kyouko, enjoying the touch of Kyouko’s skin against her own. Kyouko’s skin was warm, and her was face flushed. Mami knew what she wanted, but part of her had to make sure, just in case. “Is this… what you want, Kyouko?” she asked softly, tucking a stray piece of hair behind Kyouko’s ear. “Tell me if it’s not.” 

Kyouko nodded. She had a vague idea of what happened next. “I want this,” she confirmed. “Nothin’ would be better.” She flashed Mami a smile. 

Once again, Mami slipped her hand between them, back into the warmth between Kyouko’s legs. Her fingers rubbed slow circles, which made Kyouko groan softly. “Damn tease,” she mumbled, wrapping her arms around Mami’s waist. Mami’s response was to quickly slip two fingers inside of Kyouko. “M-Mami!” she cried, caught off guard. 

Slowly at first, and then a bit faster, Mami rubbed against the spongy flesh. Kyouko moaned softly, pressing her nails into Mami’s back. Mami’s lips brushed Kyouko’s, whose mouth searched for her own. For a moment, she found herself lost in the moment, letting emotions, and pleasure take over. 

And then Mami pressed harder, rubbing faster. In and out, in and out. Kyouko found it hard to focus. She broke the kiss and buried her face in the curve between Mami’s neck and shoulders. Vaguely, she realized that Mami smelled faintly of lavender and sweat. She closed her eyes, trying to fight the soft cries of pleasure, but finding them tumbling across her lips all the same. 

Kyouko’s nails pressed hard. She hadn’t felt like this before. Waves of pleasantness washed over her as she tried to keep herself grounded. Mami was mumbling into her ear, but she couldn’t make out what she was saying. It all blurred together, the soft cacophonous sound clashing with pleasurable feeling. Something told her it was coming to a point inside, as though she were ready to jump off the highest cliff and thrill in the adrenaline rush that would follow. 

Without knowing, Kyouko’s body had begun moving up and down, desiring more of Mami’s touch. She pressed down against Mami’s fingers, which continued to rub against her. Her moans were muffled against Mami’s skin, but they had picked up in pace. Close. So close. 

Kyouko bit Mami’s skin as something inside her seemed to snap. She shivered, riding out the gentle spasms that washed over her. She was shaking, and she held tight to Mami, needing the anchor. 

At the same time, Mami felt Kyouko’s release over her fingers. Kyouko had clenched her legs tightly, but Mami still ran her fingers over the flesh, prolonging the spasms that racked Kyouko. She felt her biting into her shoulder, but felt no pain. It felt oddly satisfying. 

Slowly, the spasms subsided, and Kyouko lay against Mami, breathing heavily. Mami slowly removed her fingers and brought them to her lips. She licked the warm fluid off, smiling seductively at Kyouko as she did so.
