When did sweet lolitia go so mainstream? Bitch goes on and on about how her ass is so great but does not show ass in video.Something i never understood when i used to go to the gym: why the fuck is the shittiest pop music always on? wouldnt you want something to get you motivated? Or is it the thought that maybe if you work out hard enough the music will go away and heavy metal will blast from all directions once you get to a certain threshold?. I&#8217;m from the UK, and we&#8217;ve only just got this song over here and it&#8217;s now number 1 and I just don&#8217;t get it. I saw on wikipedia that this shit was number one in the US a while ago though. What the hell do you see in it? Is it cos it&#8217;s a song about being fat and you love it?

Srsly guys&#8230;&#8230; The fuck is this shit?

Best advice: Stretch it. Get it warm. Get it hot. Stretch it.

I&#8217;ve seen pictures of a men stuffing entire soda cans inside their foreskins.

Do you think they were born with that ability?

No.

They stretched.
